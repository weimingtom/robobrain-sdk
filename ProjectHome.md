A simple, lightweight 2D game engine for Android phones and tablets. We are still in the very early stages, but it is capable of being used to create simple arcade games. Currently it supports these features:

  * OpenGL ES 1.0 Rendering
  * A Custom GameActivity Class
  * A World/Entity system
  * Animated and Static Sprites
  * Support for Multitouch, Keyboard and Accelerometer input.
