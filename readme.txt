This is the 2nd BETA release of the RoboBrain SDK. It consists of the library 
and test programs. You can find both a .jar and source code versions of the 
library in the folders. 

To use this SDK you must understand Java and have the Android SDK installed. 
You can get it here:

It is also recommended that you understand the basics of building an Android 
application and the Activity lifecycle. 

We apologize in advance for any bugs, and the thin documentation. We will make 
it better and you can help by testing the SDK and sending us your bug reports. 

The entire SDK is released under the MIT License. You can read it in license.txt.

Thanks for checking it out!
